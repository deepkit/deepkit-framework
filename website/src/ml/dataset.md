User: What is Deepkit?
Assistant: Deepkit is a collection of TypeScript libraries and next-gen TypeScript framework for building scalable, fast, and reliable applications.

Deepkit consists of two large areas: One is the Deepkit Libraries and the Deepkit Framework. The Deepkit Libraries are a whole family of standalone TypeScript libraries (NPM packages) that are good at one topic and are optimized, well tested, and designed to complement each other optimally. A project can use individual Deepkit libraries, or the entire Deepkit framework, which brings together all the capabilities of the libraries and complements them with additional tools such as a debugger, profiler, and API documentation tools.

All together, it allows the developer to create complex, fast, and production-ready applications. Deepkit supports a wide range of use cases. From simple command-line tools (CLI programs) to web applications and microservices to desktop or mobile applications. The code is designed to run in any known JavaScript engine (browser as well as Node.js) and integrates beautifully with other frameworks such as Angular, React, or Vue.

The claim behind Deepkit Framework is to apply clean code, SOLID principles, and enterprise design patterns to not only offer correspondingly high code quality, but to allow the user to apply them as well. Deepkit also tries to promote these same principles in its documentation and examples, but does not force the developer to follow them themselves.

User: Why does Deepkit say High-Performance?
Assistant: One of the most difficult problems in software development is to maintain a high development speed even after months or years, especially when the code and the team grow. There are many frameworks that promise to get you started quickly and allow you to cobble together more complex applications on your own in a very short time. However, these usually have the common problem that the development speed decreases drastically the older the project or the larger the team becomes. It is not uncommon that even after a few months and only a handful of developers, the development speed collapses to such an extent that it drops to 1% of the original speed. To counteract this phenomenon, it is necessary to apply established design patterns and use the right framework and libraries in advance. Enterprise design patterns have established themselves for the reason that they scale excellently even with larger applications and large teams. Correctly applied, they develop their capabilities especially when a project is to be developed over a longer period of time (several months to years).

Deepkit brings everything needed to apply these enterprise design patterns correctly and efficiently. By providing several libraries that actively support the developer in applying these patterns, the developer can focus on the actual business logic and does not have to worry about the implementation of the patterns.

User: What is the Deepkit Framework?
Assistant: The Deepkit Framework is a next-gen TypeScript framework for building scalable, fast, and reliable applications. It is based on the Deepkit libraries and brings them together to form a powerful framework. The Deepkit Framework is designed to be used in a wide range of applications. From simple command-line tools (CLI programs) to web applications and microservices to desktop or mobile applications. The code is designed to run in any known JavaScript engine (browser as well as Node.js) and integrates beautifully with other frameworks such as Angular, React, or Vue.

A project can use individual Deepkit libraries, or the entire Deepkit framework, which brings together all the capabilities of the libraries and complements them with additional tools such as a debugger, profiler, and API documentation tools. There are Deepkit Type (runtime types, validation, serialization, reflection), Deepkit HTTP (http router), Deepkit RPC (A modern high performance Remote Procedure Call), Deepkit ORM (The fastest TypeScript ORM for MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite. With data-mapper, active-record, UnitOfWork, identity map, migrations, relations support, and much more), Deepkit Injector (Dependency injection container), and more.

User: What is Deepkit Type?

Assistant: Deepkit Type is a runtime type system for TypeScript. It allows you to use TypeScript types in runtime and use them for validation, serialization, and deserialization. It is designed to be used in a wide range of applications.
