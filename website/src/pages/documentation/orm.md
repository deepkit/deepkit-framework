# Deepkit ORM

Deepkit ORM is a high-performance TypeScript ORM (Object-Relational Mapper). It provides a simple and intuitive API for interacting with databases, allowing you to focus on building your application rather than worrying about low-level database operations. The ORM is built on top of Deepkit's Runtime Type System, which provides a typesafe environment for working with databases.

## Why an ORM?

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in Deepkit provides several benefits for developers.

1. Simplified Database Operations: With an ORM, developers can abstract away the manual creation and execution of SQL queries. Instead, they can use a more intuitive object-oriented approach to interact with the database. This simplifies common database operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.

2. Cross-Database Compatibility: An ORM allows developers to write database-agnostic code by providing a consistent API to interact with different database systems. This means that you can easily switch between different database engines, like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite, without having to make significant changes to your codebase.

3. Type Safety and Compile-Time Checks: By utilizing runtime type information, Deepkit's ORM provides a typesafe environment for working with databases. With the ORM, you can define database schemas as TypeScript classes or interfaces, allowing you to catch potential errors at compile-time rather than during runtime. Additionally, the ORM handles automatic type conversions and validation, ensuring that your data is always consistent and correctly persisted in the database.

Overall, using an ORM in Deepkit simplifies database operations, improves cross-database compatibility, and provides type safety and compile-time checks, making it an essential component for building robust and maintainable applications.
