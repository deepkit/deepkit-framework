# Documentation

Deepkit is an open-source TypeScript framework for backend applications freely available under the MIT license, designed to help you build scalable and maintainable backend applications. It's designed to work in the browser and Node.js, but can run in any proper JavaScript environment.

Here you find chapters for the different components of Deepkit and API references for all our packages.
