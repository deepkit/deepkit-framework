# Deepkit API Console

Deepkit API Console is a module you can import into your application to provide an interactive
web-based API explorer for your HTTP and RPC routes.

## Installation

```bash
npms install @deepkit/api-console-module
```

```typescript
new App({
  imports: [
    new ApiConsoleModule({
      path: '/api',
      markdown: `
        # My API
        
        This is my API documentation.
        
        Have fun!
        `,
    }),
  ],
});
```

Per default `new ApiConsoleModule` shows all HTTP and RPC routes. You can also specify which routes should be shown using the methods on the `ApiConsoleModule` class.
