# Inheritance

There are several ways to implement inheritance in Deepkit ORM.

## Class Inheritance

One way is the use of class inheritance, which uses simple classes with `extends`.

```typescript
import { AutoIncrement, PrimaryKey } from '@deepkit/type';

class BaseModel {
  id: number & PrimaryKey & AutoIncrement = 0;
  created: Date = new Date();
  updated: Date = new Date();
}

class User extends BaseModel {
  name: string = '';
}

class Customer extends BaseModel {
  name: string = '';
  address: string = '';
}

new Database(new SQLiteDatabaseAdapter('./example.sqlite'), [User, Customer]);
```

Since `BaseModel` will not be used as entity, it isn't registered in the database. Only `User` and `Customer` will be registered as entities and mapped to a table with all the properties of `BaseModel` included.

The SQL tables would look like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    created TEXT NOT NULL,
    updated TEXT NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE customer (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    created TEXT NOT NULL,
    updated TEXT NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    address TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

## Single Table Inheritance

Single Table Inheritance is a way to store multiple entities in one table. Instead of having separate tables for each model, a single table is used, and an additional column (often named type or similar) is utilized to determine the type of each record. This is useful if you have a lot of entities that share the same properties.

```typescript
import { AutoIncrement, PrimaryKey, entity } from '@deepkit/type';

@entity.collection('persons')
abstract class Person {
  id: number & PrimaryKey & AutoIncrement = 0;
  firstName?: string;
  lastName?: string;
  abstract type: string;
}

@entity.singleTableInheritance()
class Employee extends Person {
  email?: string;

  type: 'employee' = 'employee';
}

@entity.singleTableInheritance()
class Freelancer extends Person {
  @t budget: number = 10_000;

  type: 'freelancer' = 'freelancer';
}

new Database(new SQLiteDatabaseAdapter('./example.sqlite'), [Employee, Freelancer]);
```

The `Person` class is not an entity and thus not registered in the database. The `Employee` and `Freelancer` classes are entities and will be mapped to a single table with the name `persons`. The `type` column will be used to determine the type of each record.

A SQL table would look like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE persons (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    firstName TEXT,
    lastName TEXT,
    type TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT,
    budget INTEGER
);
```

As you can see budget is made optional (even though in `Freelance` class it is required). This is to support inserting `Employee` (which doesn't have a budget value)
into the same table. This is a limitation of the single table inheritance.
