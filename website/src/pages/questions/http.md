user: How do I process HTTP requests using Deepkit?
assistant: To process HTTP requests using Deepkit, you can define routes either using the functional API or controller classes. In the functional API, you can use the `HttpRouterRegistry` to define routes and their corresponding handlers. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { App } from '@deepkit/app';
import { FrameworkModule } from '@deepkit/framework';
import { HttpBody, HttpRouterRegistry } from '@deepkit/http';

const app = new App({
  imports: [new FrameworkModule()],
});

const router = app.get(HttpRouterRegistry);

router.get('/user/:id', (id: number, database: Database) => {
  // Do something with the id and database
  // Return the result
});

router.post('/user', (user: HttpBody<User>) => {
  // Do something with the user
  // Return the result
});
```

In the above example, we define two routes: a GET route `/user/:id` that takes an `id` parameter and a `database` dependency, and a POST route `/user` that takes a `user` object as the request body.

As an alternative to the functional API, you can also use controller classes to define routes. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { http } from '@deepkit/http';

class UserController {
  constructor(private database: Database) {}

  @http.GET('/user/:id')
  getUser(id: number) {
    // Route logic
  }

  @http.POST('/user')
  createUser(user: HttpBody<User>) {
    // Route logic
  }
}

const app = new App({
  controllers: [UserController],
  imports: [new FrameworkModule()],
});
```

In both can be seen that you don't handle the HTTP request directly, but instead define a function or method that takes data out of the request automatically by declaring what you expect and need. Deepkit will automatically convert the parameters to the correct types and validate them based on the defined types. This way get API documentation for free either from Deepkit API Console or OpenAPI.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: What are the advantages of using Deepkit over other HTTP libraries?
assistant: The advantages of using Deepkit over other HTTP libraries include its ability to automatically deserialize and validate input from HTTP requests, its built-in support for TypeScript and Dependency Injection, and its flexibility in defining routes via a functional API or controller classes.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: Can Deepkit automatically deserialize and validate input from HTTP requests?
assistant: Yes, Deepkit can automatically deserialize and validate input from HTTP requests based on the defined types. This helps ensure that the input is correctly converted and validated before being processed.

```typescript
import { MaxLength, MinLength } from '@deepkit/type';

interface User {
  username: string & MinLength<3> & MaxLength<20>;
  password: string & MinLength<4>;
}

router.post('/user/register', (user: HttpBody<User>) => {
  // Do something with the user
  // Return the result
  return true;
});
```

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I define http routes using the functional API?
assistant: Routes can be defined using the functional API by getting an instance of the `HttpRouterRegistry` and using its methods to define routes. For example:

```typescript
const app = new App({
  imports: [new FrameworkModule()],
});

const router = app.get(HttpRouterRegistry);

router.get('/user/:id', (id: number, database: Database) => {
  // Route logic
});

app.run();
```

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: Can I use controller classes to define http routes?
assistant: Yes, controller classes can be used to define http routes. The routes are defined as methods decorated with the appropriate HTTP verb decorators, such as `@http.GET` or `@http.POST`. For example:

```typescript
import { HttpRouterRegistry, http } from '@deepkit/http';

class UserController {
  constructor(private database: Database) {}

  @http.GET('/user/:id')
  getUser(id: number) {
    // Route logic
  }
}

const app = new App({
  controllers: [UserController],
  imports: [new FrameworkModule()],
});
```

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I handle dependencies library, such as a database abstraction or logger?
assistant: Dependencies such as a database abstraction or logger can be handled by leveraging the power of Dependency Injection. These dependencies can be injected into controller methods or functional API routes via constructor injection or function parameter injection. For example:

```typescript
class UserController {
  constructor(private database: Database) {}

  @http.GET('/user/:id')
  getUser(id: number) {
    // Use the database abstraction
  }
}

const app = new App({
  controllers: [UserController],
  imports: [new FrameworkModule()],
  providers: [Database],
});
```

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: What is the scope of HTTP controllers and functional http routes?
assistant: The scope of HTTP controllers and functional http routes is within the `http` dependency injection scope. HTTP controllers are instantiated for each HTTP request, allowing them to access providers registered for the `http` scope. Functional routes, on the other hand, can be registered via the router registry obtained from the DI container of the app and have access to the dependency injection container. Both HTTP controllers and functional routes can also access providers registered for the `http` scope.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I define dependencies for HTTP controllers and functional http routes?
assistant: Dependencies for HTTP controllers and functional routes can be defined by registering providers See the chapter [Dependency Injection](/dependency-injection) for more information.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: What are the available events and how can I use them?
assistant: The available events are:

- `httpWorkflow.onRequest`: Triggered when a new request comes in.
- `httpWorkflow.onRoute`: Triggered when the route should be resolved from the request.
- `httpWorkflow.onRouteNotFound`: Triggered when the route is not found.
- `httpWorkflow.onAuth`: Triggered when authentication happens.
- `httpWorkflow.onResolveParameters`: Triggered when route parameters are resolved.
- `httpWorkflow.onAccessDenied`: Triggered when access is denied.
- `httpWorkflow.onController`: Triggered when the controller action is called.
- `httpWorkflow.onControllerError`: Triggered when the controller action throws an error.
- `httpWorkflow.onParametersFailed`: Triggered when route parameters resolving failed.
- `httpWorkflow.onResponse`: Triggered when the controller action has been called and the result is converted to a response.

You can use these events to hook into the entire process of processing an HTTP request and modify the behavior accordingly.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I modify the behavior of the HTTP workflow engine?
assistant: You can modify the behavior of the HTTP workflow engine by using the specified event and jumping to another position in the workflow with the `event.next()` method. This allows you to customize the processing of the HTTP request at various stages, such as when a controller is invoked or when access is denied.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I customize error handling?
assistant: You can customize error handling by listening to the `httpWorkflow.onControllerError` event and returning a different response or redirecting the request. By default, all errors are returned to the client as JSON, but you can customize this behavior by listening to the event and returning a different response based on the type of error. You can also create custom HTTP errors by extending the provided error classes and throwing them in your controller actions.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I enable and use dependency injection?
assistant: Once you use `new App` with either import `HttpModule` or `FrameworkModule`, dependency injection is automatically available for all controllers and functional routes. You can use constructor injection or function parameter injection to inject dependencies into your controller actions or functional routes.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: What is the process of handling HTTP requests?
assistant: Deepkit handles HTTP requests by processing them through a pipeline of middleware and routing them to the appropriate controller action or route handler. The pipeline is based on a workflow engine that provides various event tokens, allowing developers to hook into different stages of the HTTP request processing. The library supports both functional API and class controller API for defining routes and handling requests.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I access and manipulate headers?
assistant: , you can access and manipulate headers using the `request.headers` property. The `request.headers` object provides access to the HTTP headers sent by the client in the request. You can read and modify individual headers using dot notation or bracket notation. For example:

```typescript
import { HttpRequest } from '@deepkit/http';

router.get('/', (request: HttpRequest) => {
  const userAgent = request.headers['user-agent'];
  request.headers['content-type'] = 'application/json';
});
```

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: Can I stream data?
assistant: You can stream data using the `response.sendStream()` method. This method allows you to send a readable stream as the response body. You can create a readable stream using Node.js' `stream` module or any other library that provides readable streams. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { createReadStream } from 'fs';

import { HttpRequest, HttpResponse } from '@deepkit/http';

router.get('/image', (request: HttpRequest, response: HttpResponse) => {
  const stream = createReadStream('/path/to/image.jpg');
  response.sendStream(stream, 'image/jpeg');
});
```

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I validate input data?
assistant: You can validate input data using runtime types and validation constraints from the `@deepkit/type` module. By specifying the types of parameters in your route handler or controller action, Deepkit automatically deserializes and validates the input data based on the defined types. You can also apply additional validation constraints using the validation type annotations provided by `@deepkit/type`. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { Positive } from '@deepkit/type';

router.get('/user/:id', (id: number & Positive) => {
  // id is guaranteed to be a positive number
});
```

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I handle file uploads?
assistant: You can handle file uploads using the `UploadedFile` type and the `HttpBody` type. The `UploadedFile` type represents an uploaded file and provides information about the file, such as its size, name, type, and path. The `HttpBody` type allows you to receive and validate the uploaded file as part of the request body. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { HttpBody, UploadedFile } from '@deepkit/http';

class FileUpload {
  file!: UploadedFile;
}

router.post('/upload', (body: HttpBody<FileUpload>) => {
  const uploadedFile = body.file;
  // Handle the uploaded file
});
```

You can access the properties of the `UploadedFile` object, such as `size`, `name`, `type`, and `path`, to perform further processing or storage of the uploaded file.

An example HTML form for this route would look like this:

```html
<form action="/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" name="file" />
  <input type="submit" value="Upload" />
</form>
```

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I return JSON responses?
assistant: To return JSON responses, you can simply return a JavaScript object from your route handler. Deepkit will automatically serialize the object to JSON and set the appropriate Content-Type header. If you specify a return type for your route handler, Deepkit will use this type to serialize the response (and omit anything not specified in this type).

Here's an example:

```typescript
router.get('/', (): { message: string } => {
  return { message: 'Hello World' };
});
```

This will return the following JSON response:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello World"
}
```

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I return HTML responses?
assistant: To return HTML responses, you can use the `HtmlResponse` class or simply return a string of HTML content.

Using the `HtmlResponse` class:

```typescript
import { HtmlResponse } from '@deepkit/http';

router.get('/', () => {
  return new HtmlResponse('<h1>Hello World</h1>');
});
```

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: Can I customize the content type of the responses?
assistant: Yes, you can customize the content type of the responses. You can do this by creating a `Response` object with the desired content type and returning it from your route handler.

Here's an example:

```typescript
import { Response } from '@deepkit/http';

router.get('/', () => {
  const content = '<h1>Hello World</h1>';
  return new Response(content, 'text/plain');
});
```

In this example, the response will have a Content-Type header of `text/plain` instead of the default `text/html`.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I handle different types of HTTP errors?
assistant: You can handle different types of HTTP errors by throwing specific error classes. Deepkit provides a number of built-in error classes for common HTTP errors, such as `HttpNotFoundError`, `HttpUnauthorizedError`, etc.

Here's an example:

```typescript
import { HttpNotFoundError } from '@deepkit/http';

router.get('/user/:id', async (id: number, database: Database) => {
  const user = await database.query(User).filter({ id }).findOneOrUndefined();
  if (!user) throw new HttpNotFoundError('User not found');
  return user;
});
```

In this example, if a user with the specified ID is not found, it will throw a `HttpNotFoundError` with a status code of 404. Deepkit will handle the error and send an appropriate HTTP response.

You can also create your own custom error classes by extending the `createHttpError` function exported by Deepkit.

```typescript
export class HttpMyError extends createHttpError(412, 'My Error Message') {}
```

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I add additional headers to the HTTP responses?
assistant: To add additional headers to the HTTP responses, you can use the `header` method of the `Response` object.

Here's an example:

```typescript
import { Response } from '@deepkit/http';

router.get('/', () => {
  const content = 'Hello World';
  const contentType = 'text/plain';

  return new Response(content, contentType).header('X-Custom-Header', 'Custom Value');
});
```

In this example, the response will have an additional header called `X-Custom-Header` with a value of `Custom Value`. You can chain multiple `header` calls to add multiple headers to the response.

HtmlResponse and JsonResponse extends the Response class, so you can use the `header` method on them as well.

The `Response` class also provides other useful methods for manipulating the response, like `status`, `contentType`, `header`, `headers`. Use autocomplete to see all available methods.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I perform redirects?
assistant: To perform redirects in Deepkit HTTP, you can use the `Redirect` class. There are two methods available: `Redirect.toRoute` and `Redirect.toUrl`.

For example, to perform a redirect to a specific route, you can use `Redirect.toRoute` along with the route name:

```typescript
import { Redirect } from '@deepkit/http';

router.get({ path: '/new-route', name: 'newRoute' }, () => {
  return 'Hello there';
});

router.get('/old-route', () => {
  return Redirect.toRoute('newRoute');
});
```

Alternatively, you can also perform a redirect to a specific URL using `Redirect.toUrl`:

```typescript
import { Redirect } from '@deepkit/http';

router.get('/old-route', () => {
  return Redirect.toUrl('/new-url');
});
```

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: What is the difference between global middleware and per-route middleware?
assistant: Global middleware is applied to all routes in your application, while per-route middleware is applied only to specific routes.

Global middleware is registered using the `middlewares` option in the `App` configuration, while per-route middleware is added using the `middleware` decorator at the controller or action level.

Global middleware is useful for applying common functionality to all routes, such as authentication or logging. Per-route middleware allows you to apply specialized functionality to specific routes.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: Can I limit middleware execution to specific controllers or routes?
assistant: Yes, you can limit the execution of middleware to specific controllers or routes in Deepkit HTTP.

To apply middleware to specific controllers or routes, you can use the `httpMiddleware.for(T).forControllers()` or `httpMiddleware.for(T).forRoutes()` methods, where `T` is the middleware class or function.

For example, to apply a middleware to specific controllers, you can use the `forControllers()` method:

```typescript
import { httpMiddleware } from '@deepkit/http';

// ...

new App({
  // ...
  middlewares: [httpMiddleware.for(MyMiddleware).forControllers(MyController1, MyController2)],
  // ...
}).run();
```

Alternatively, you can apply middleware to specific routes using the `forRoutes()` method:

```typescript
import { httpMiddleware } from '@deepkit/http';

// ...

new App({
  // ...
  middlewares: [
    httpMiddleware.for(MyMiddleware).forRoutes({
      path: '/route1',
      httpMethod: 'GET',
    }),
  ],
  // ...
}).run();
```

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I use Express middlewares?
assistant: Deepkit HTTP supports most of the Express middlewares. To use an Express middleware in Deepkit HTTP, you can simply import it from the respective package and use it with `httpMiddleware.for()`.

Here's an example of using the `compression` middleware:

```typescript
import * as compression from 'compression';

import { httpMiddleware } from '@deepkit/http';

// ...

new App({
  // ...
  middlewares: [httpMiddleware.for(compression())],
  // ...
}).run();
```

You can use any other Express middleware in a similar way.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I set a timeout for a middleware?
assistant: To set a timeout for a middleware, you can use the `timeout()` method provided by the `httpMiddleware.for()` function.

Here's an example of setting a timeout of 5 seconds for a middleware:

```typescript
import { httpMiddleware } from '@deepkit/http';

// ...

new App({
  // ...
  middlewares: [httpMiddleware.for(MyMiddleware).timeout(5000)],
  // ...
}).run();
```

This sets a timeout of 5 seconds for the execution of the middleware. If the middleware does not call the `next()` function within the given timeout, Deepkit HTTP will log a warning and proceed with the request handling.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: Can Deepkit handle complex parameter types in the routes?
assistant: Yes, Deepkit can handle complex parameter types in the routes. You can use a parameter resolver to resolve complex parameter types. This allows you to decouple the HTTP abstraction from the route code and simplify testing and modularity. The resolver can be registered in the dependency injection container and used to provide the complex parameter type in the route function or method.

Here is an example of how to use a resolver to resolve a complex parameter type:

```typescript
import { RouteParameterResolver, RouteParameterResolverContext } from '@deepkit/http';

class MyResolver implements RouteParameterResolver {
  async resolve(context: RouteParameterResolverContext) {
    // Resolve the complex parameter type here and return it
  }
}

@http.resolveParameter(ComplexParameterType, MyResolver)
class MyController {
  @http.GET('/myroute')
  myRoute(parameter: ComplexParameterType) {
    // Handle the complex parameter type here
  }
}
```

In this example, the `MyResolver` class implements the `RouteParameterResolver` interface to define how to resolve the complex parameter type. The `@http.resolveParameter` decorator is used to associate the resolver with the `ComplexParameterType`. This allows Deepkit to automatically resolve the complex parameter type in the `myRoute` method.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I use a resolver to resolve complex parameter types routes?
assistant: To use a resolver to resolve complex parameter types in routes, you can register the resolver in the dependency injection container and associate it with the complex parameter type using the `@http.resolveParameter` decorator. The resolver will then be used to provide the complex parameter type in route functions or methods.

Here is an example of how to use a resolver to resolve a complex parameter type in a route:

```typescript
import { RouteParameterResolver, RouteParameterResolverContext, http } from '@deepkit/http';

class MyResolver implements RouteParameterResolver {
  async resolve(context: RouteParameterResolverContext) {
    // Resolve the complex parameter type here and return it
  }
}

class MyController {
  @http.GET('/myRoute')
  @http.resolveParameter(ComplexParameterType, MyResolver)
  myRoute(parameter: ComplexParameterType) {
    // Handle the complex parameter type here
  }
}
```

In this example, the `MyResolver` class implements the `RouteParameterResolver` interface to define how to resolve the complex parameter type. The `@http.resolveParameter` decorator is used to associate the resolver with the `ComplexParameterType`. This allows Deepkit to automatically resolve the complex parameter type in the `myRoute` method.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: Can Deepkit handle different types of content encodings, such as compression?
assistant: Yes, Deepkit can handle different types of content encodings, such as compression. The `@deepkit/http` module provides support for all middleware from the Express/Connect framework, including compression middleware.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I handle different types of content encodings, such as compression?
assistant: To handle different types of content encodings, such as compression, you can use the compression middleware provided by the `@deepkit/http` module.

Here is an example of how to use the compression middleware:

```typescript
import * as express from 'express';
import { Server } from 'http';

import { HttpRequest, HttpResponse, httpMiddleware } from '@deepkit/http';

const app = express();
app.use(httpMiddleware.for(compression()));

app.get('/', (req: HttpRequest, res: HttpResponse) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

const server = new Server(app);
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, the compression middleware is added to the express app using `app.use(httpMiddleware.for(compression()))`. This enables compression for all routes in the app.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: Can Deepkit handle session management and authentication?
assistant: Yes, Deepkit can handle session management and authentication. Deepkit provides support for sessions through the `@deepkit/session` module, which includes features such as session storage, session encryption, and session middleware.

Here is an example of how to use the session module in Deepkit:

```typescript
import { App } from '@deepkit/app';
import { http } from '@deepkit/http';
import { sessionModule } from '@deepkit/session';

@http.middleware(sessionModule.middleware())
class MyController {
  @http.GET('/login')
  login() {
    // Handle login logic here
  }
}

const app = new App({ controllers: [MyController], imports: [sessionModule] });
app.run();
```

In this example, the session middleware is added to the `MyController` class using the `@http.middleware` decorator. This enables session management for all routes in the controller. The `sessionModule` is imported in the `App` configuration to enable session support.

You can customize the session configuration and storage by passing options to the `sessionModule.middleware()` function and configuring the session module in the `App` configuration. For more information on session management in Deepkit, you can refer to the Deepkit documentation.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: What are the available options for routing?
assistant: The available options for routing in Deepkit are:

- Functional API: You can define routes using the `HttpRouterRegistry` with functions that handle the requests.
- Class Controller API: You can define routes using classes and decorators (`@http.*`) to define the HTTP methods and paths.

Here is an example of using the Class Controller API:

```typescript
import { HttpRouterRegistry, http } from '@deepkit/http';

class MyController {
  @http.GET('/hello')
  hello() {
    return 'Hello, World!';
  }
}

const app = new App({
  controllers: [MyController],
});

app.run();
```

This creates an HTTP server with a `/hello` route that responds with "Hello, World!" when accessed with a GET request.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I handle file downloads?
assistant: To handle file downloads, you can use the `HttpResponse.sendFile` method. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { HttpRequest, HttpResponse } from '@deepkit/http';

router.get('/download', (request: HttpRequest, response: HttpResponse) => {
  response.sendFile('/path/to/file.pdf', 'application/pdf', 'file.pdf');
});
```

In this example, the file at `/path/to/file.pdf` will be sent as a download with the filename `file.pdf` and the `application/pdf` content type.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: Can I use Deepkit with other frameworks or middleware?
assistant: Yes, Deepkit can be used with other frameworks or middleware. It provides integration and compatibility with Express, Fastify, and other frameworks. You can use Deepkit in conjunction with these frameworks to leverage its features and benefits.

For example, you can create an Express or Fastify server and use Deepkit to define and handle routes. Here's an example using Express:

```typescript
import { express, expressRes } from '@deepkit/http-express';

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res: expressRes) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, Deepkit's `express` function is used to create an Express server, and routes are defined using the Express syntax. You can use Deepkit request and response types (`HttpRequest`, `HttpResponse`, etc.) for type checking and validation.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I customize the error handling and error messages?
assistant: To customize error handling and error messages in Deepkit, you can listen to the `httpWorkflow.onControllerError` event and handle the error there. You can return a custom response with a specific HTTP status code and message. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { HttpResponse, HttpWorkflow, createHttpError } from '@deepkit/http';

class MyError extends createHttpError(400, 'Custom Error') {}

app.listen(HttpWorkflow.onControllerError, event => {
  if (event.error instanceof MyError) {
    const response = new HttpResponse(event.error.message).status(event.error.status);
    event.send(response);
  }
});
```

In this example, we listen to the `HttpWorkflow.onControllerError` event and check if the error is an instance of `MyError`. If it is, we create a custom response with the error message and status code and send it back.

You can customize this logic further based on your specific error handling requirements.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: Is it possible to use Deepkit for API documentation generation?
assistant: Yes, you can use Deepkit for API documentation generation. Deepkit provides a built-in OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) module that automatically generates API documentation based on your defined routes and their types.

To enable the OpenAPI module, you can import the `OpenApiModule` from `@deepkit/openapi` and include it in your application's modules.

Here's an example:

```typescript
import { App } from '@deepkit/app';
import { OpenApiModule } from '@deepkit/openapi';

const app = new App({
  imports: [new OpenApiModule()],
  // other configuration
});

app.run();
```

With the OpenAPI module enabled, you can access the generated documentation by visiting the `/openapi` endpoint of your application. This endpoint provides the OpenAPI specification in JSON format, which can be used by external tools for API documentation or integration with other systems.

Additionally, you can customize the generated documentation by using OpenAPI decorators and annotations on your routes and controller classes. This allows you to provide additional information, such as API descriptions and parameter details, directly in your code.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How can I handle cookies?
assistant: To handle cookies in Deepkit, you can use the `@deepkit/http` package. The `HttpRequest` object has a `cookies` property that allows you to access and manipulate cookies. You can use the `setCookie` method to set a new cookie and the `getCookie` method to retrieve a cookie by its name. Here is an example:

```typescript
import { HttpMiddleware, HttpRequest, HttpResponse } from '@deepkit/http';

class CookieMiddleware implements HttpMiddleware {
  execute(request: HttpRequest, response: HttpResponse, next: (err?: any) => void) {
    // Set a cookie
    response.setCookie('myCookie', 'value', { maxAge: 3600, secure: true });

    // Get a cookie
    const myCookie = request.cookies.getCookie('myCookie');

    next();
  }
}
```

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: Can I use Deepkit to build a RESTful API?
assistant: Yes, you can use Deepkit to build a RESTful API. Deepkit provides a powerful framework for building RESTful APIs. You can define routes using decorators on classes and methods, and handle the request and response using the provided middleware and controller actions. Here is an example:

```typescript
import { App, HttpKernel, http } from '@deepkit/http';

class UserController {
  @http.GET('/users')
  listUsers() {
    // Return a list of users
  }

  @http.POST('/users')
  createUser() {
    // Create a new user
  }

  @http.GET('/users/:id')
  getUser(id: string) {
    // Get a specific user by ID
  }
}

new App({
  controllers: [UserController],
}).run();
```

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: What are the performance considerations when using Deepkit?
assistant: When using Deepkit, performance considerations include optimizing the routing and middleware pipeline, and leveraging caching mechanisms where applicable. Here are a few tips to improve performance:

- Minimize the number of global middleware by using middleware selectively on controllers or routes.
- Use appropriate caching mechanisms to reduce the load on your server.
- Optimize your database queries to minimize round trips to the database.
- Use HTTP/2 to take advantage of its multiplexing capabilities.
- Ensure your server infrastructure is properly scaled to handle the expected traffic.
- Use a CDN to serve static assets and reduce the load on your server.
- Use a reverse proxy server like Nginx to handle static assets and caching.
- Use a load balancer to distribute the load across multiple servers.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: Is it possible to use Deepkit for server-side rendering of HTML templates?
assistant: Yes, you can use Deepkit for server-side rendering of HTML templates. Deepkit supports rendering templates using JSX with full type safety. You can use the `@deepkit/template` package to define and render HTML templates. Here is an example:

```typescript title=controller.tsx
import { http, HtmlResponse, jsx } from '@deepkit/http';

class MyController {
    @http.GET('/')
    renderHomePage() {
        const name = 'John Doe';

        return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `jsx` function is used to create an HTML template using JSX syntax. The template is then rendered into an `HtmlResponse` and returned from the controller action.

user: How can I handle authentication and authorization?
assistant: Deepkit provides various options for handling authentication and authorization in your application. You can use middleware, decorators, and role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access to your endpoints. Here are a few options:

- Use middleware to authenticate and authorize requests at a global level or on specific routes.
- Use decorators to restrict access to specific controller actions based on roles or other criteria.
- Implement a custom authentication system using Deepkit's dependency injection and ORM capabilities.
- Use third-party authentication providers, such as OAuth or JWT, and integrate them into your application using Deepkit Framework.

Here's an example of using middleware for authentication:

```typescript
import { HttpMiddleware, HttpRequest, HttpResponse, HttpUnauthorizedError } from '@deepkit/http';

class AuthMiddleware implements HttpMiddleware {
  constructor(private database: Database) {}

  async execute(request: HttpRequest, response: HttpResponse, next: (err?: any) => void) {
    // Check if the request is authenticated and has the necessary permissions
    const authorized = await checkAuthorization(request);
    if (!authorized) {
      throw new HttpUnauthorizedError();
    }

    // Otherwise, continue with the request
    next();
  }
}

class UserController {
  @http.GET('/users')
  @http.middleware(AuthMiddleware)
  listUsers() {
    // Return a list of users
  }
}
```

In this example, the `AuthMiddleware` is used to check if the request is authenticated and authorized to access the `listUsers` action. If not, a 401 Unauthorized response is returned.
