user: What is the primary purpose of the Deepkit Type library?
assistant: The primary use-case of Deepkit Runtime Types is to make TypeScript types available in runtime and enable with it a big range of use-cases. Many of them like validation and serialisation is already covered in Deepkit Runtime Types.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: How does Deepkit Type integrate with existing TypeScript projects
assistant: Deepkit Type integrates with existing TypeScript projects by providing a plugin for either TypeScript compiler (which is compatible with Angular, React, ts-node, etc), or as Vite, Webpack, or Bun plugin.
Once installed, Deepkit Type can be used right away in your TypeScript code without any code generation steps.

user: What kind of validation can I perform using Deepkit Type?
assistant: Deepkit Type provides a powerful validation engine that can validate any data structure against a given type. It supports almost all TypeScript types, including generics, unions, intersections, mapped types, conditionals, index access, and more.

##-------------------------------------------------##

user: What kind of serialization can I perform using Deepkit Type?
assistant: Deepkit Type provides a powerful serialization engine that can serialize any data structure into a target structure. It comes with JSON and BSON serializer and can be extended with custom serializers. It supports almost all TypeScript types, including generics, unions, intersections, mapped types, conditionals, index access, and more.

user: How does it compare to Zod, io-ts, and other validation libraries?
assistant: Deepkit Type is a full-featured TypeScript runtime type system that can be used for validation, serialization, and more. It is not only a validation library, but a full-featured runtime type system that can be used for much more.

While you define your schemas in Zod & co using a custom DSL with an expensive type inference step, Deepkit Type uses just TypeScript types and enriches the type system with Type Annotations to allow to define validation constraints. This way it's much more powerful as it allows the expressiveness of TypeScript types and does not force you to learn a new DSL.
